# De Novo Drug Discovery Graduation Project

A research-driven pipeline for generating novel, valid small molecules targeting specific proteins using reinforcement learning and cheminformatics tools.

---

## üöÄ Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a De Novo Drug Discovery pipeline built on top of [REINVENT4](https://github.com/MolecularAI/REINVENT4). It uses a curriculum-based reinforcement learning approach to generate and optimize molecular structures with high affinity for a predefined protein scaffold.

Key features:
- **Generative Modeling**: Produces SMILES strings via an RL agent fine-tuned on a target scaffold.
- **Validity Filtering**: Ensures chemical validity with RDKit syntax & valency checks.
- **Curriculum Learning**: Six-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Extensible**: Easily adapt to new target proteins or scoring functions.

## üìã Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- RDKit
- PyTorch (or TensorFlow, depending on your REINVENT4 backend)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
